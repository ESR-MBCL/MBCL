# Temperature Impacts on the Environment of Mount Baker

### Project Overview
The ecosystems on Mount Baker are intricately linked to the plant species that inhabit them. These plants play a critical role in maintaining the biodiversity and health of the region's environment. However, as global temperatures rise due to climate change, many plant species are experiencing shifts in their ability to survive and thrive. Temperature is a crucial factor in the growth, reproduction, and overall health of plants, and even small fluctuations can have significant impacts.

To better understand how rising temperatures affect the ecosystems of Mount Baker, my project focused on analyzing temperature data collected from shaded iButtons placed in Schreiber’s Meadow. These iButtons, small temperature sensors, provide real-time data on the environmental conditions plants are exposed to. The main objective of this project was to analyze whether these temperatures reached or exceeded the critical temperature thresholds for specific plant species in the area.

### Plants Studied
In Schreiber’s Meadow, we focused on four plant species that are integral to the ecosystem. These species include:
- Heather (Calluna vulgaris)
- White Mountain Heather/Arctic Bell Heather (Cassiope mertensiana)
- Bog Laurel (Kalmia polifolia)
- Stream Violet (Viola glabella)

Each of these plants has specific temperature ranges in which they are able to grow and reproduce. When temperatures surpass these thresholds, the plants' ability to survive can be compromised. In some cases, this may lead to shifts in the plant communities or even the loss of certain species from the ecosystem.

### Data Analysis and Findings

| Plant | Link to Data Graph | Link to Data Table|
|-----|-----|-----|
| Heather | [Heather_Graph](./Heather/Heather_1_shaded_graph.html) | [Heather_Table](./Heather/Heather_1_shaded_table.html) |
| White Heather | [White_Heather_Graph](./WhiteHeather/WhiteHeather_1_shaded_graph.html) | [White_Heather_Table](./White_Heather/WhiteHeather_1_shaded_table.html) |
| Bog Laurel | [Bog_Laurel_Graph](./Bog_Laurel/Bog_Laurel_graph.html) | [Bog_Laurel_Table](./Bog_Laurel/Bog_Laurel_table.html) |
| Stream Violet | [Stream_Violet_Graph](./Stream_Violet/Stream_Violet_graph.html) | [Stream_Violet_Table](./Stream_Violet/Stream_Violet_table.html) |

The iButton data revealed temperature patterns throughout Schreiber’s Meadow, which we compared against the known temperature thresholds of the plants under study. By assessing how often temperatures exceeded or remained within the safe limits for each species, we gained insight into the potential impacts of rising temperatures on the local ecosystem.

For example, some of the plants in the meadow may have been exposed to temperatures higher than what is typical for their growth cycle, especially during peak summer months. This can disrupt their natural processes, such as flowering and seed production, ultimately affecting their population size and distribution.

### Conclusion

Project Overview: Analyzing Temperature Thresholds of Plants on Mount Baker

Understanding these temperature dynamics is crucial for anticipating the long-term effects of climate change on the ecosystems of Mount Baker. Continued monitoring and analysis are needed to track these changes over time and to inform conservation efforts aimed at protecting these vital habitats.

Through this project, we hope to contribute valuable data to the ongoing research on climate change impacts and provide a clearer picture of how warming temperatures are reshaping the natural world.
