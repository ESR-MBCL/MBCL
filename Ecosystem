What Lapse rates tell us about the ecosystem

Ideas
- A steep lapse rate indicates an unstable atmosphere, leading to more convective activity like thunderstorms, which can influence vegetation patterns by 
affecting water availability and nutrient distribution. Conversely, a stable lapse rate with a smaller temperature change with altitude means less convective 
activity and potentially drier conditions.
- Different plants are used to different temperature ranges
- A steeper lapse rate can lead to more frequent cloud formation and precipitation at higher altitudes, impacting the water availability for plants in mountainous regions.
